Puzzle Miner is an attempt to revamp every system in the game with "more fun" systems.

The largest modification is the mining system itself. Players will still craft a wooden pickaxe which is then used to mine one block. Just one. Before it breaks.
However, what should be immediately obvious is the difference in the mining system.

Blocks are divided into four tiers of breakability:
 Tier 0 (Wood): Breaks Stone only
 Tier 1 (Stone): Breaks Dense Rock
 Tier 2 (Iron): Breaks Obsidian
 Tier 3 (Diamond): Breaks Diamond

 When a block is mined, the base material is dropped as well. This results in the following:
 Stone: Drops Cobblestone
 Dense Rock: Drops Stone
 Obsidian: Drops Obsidian
 Diamond: Drops Diamond Blocks

 This means these four items will become the most common items in the game. Which is fine because they won't be the most pivotal items available.

Each block will be composed of one of these four outer block shells. What is contained within is what changes:

Directional Block: Points in a direction indicating anything adjacent in the direction pointed in will be broken as well when mined.
Bomb Block: Blows up all 26 adjacent blocks around it as well.
xY Block: Multiplies all items gathered and mob spawns from this mining attempt by Y.
Mob block: Spawns mobs.
Ore Block: Provides a type of ore or resource. Every resource comes with its own variety and perks for each type of tool created.
